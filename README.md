# Art Gallery HTML Project

## Overview

This project is a simple **HTML webpage** that showcases an art gallery of five different artworks. It demonstrates the use of fundamental HTML elements.

## File

* **art_gallery.html** — The main HTML file containing the gallery.

## Features Implemented

* **HTML Boilerplate**: Includes `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, and `<body>`.
* **Headings & Paragraphs**: Uses `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<p>` for structure and descriptions.
* **Comments**: HTML comments to explain different sections.
* **Text Formatting**: Examples of `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<u>`, and `<del>` for emphasis and edits.
* **Images**: At least 5 artworks displayed with meaningful `alt` text and `width`/`height` attributes.
* **Anchors (Links)**: Internal links to artworks and an external link to [Tate](https://www.tate.org.uk).
* **Horizontal Rules & Line Breaks**: Uses `<hr>` to separate sections and `<br>` for line breaks.
* **Lists**:

  * Ordered list (`<ol>`) showing steps to create a gallery (with `type` and `value` attributes).
  * Unordered list (`<ul>`) showing materials and techniques.
* **Table**: Compares the artworks by medium and year.

2. Open `art_gallery.html` in any web browser.
